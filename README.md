Visual Vocals is an interactive visualization for demonstrating the anatomy of speech. It follows the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and it is intended to be used as a universal language script.

Uses:
- pronounce language sounds based on speech positions rather than relying on transliterated approximations
- learn language sounds without the additional burden of memorizing abstract scripts. Good for kids.
- learn how to pronounce words naturally. Good for the deaf, blind and speech impaired.
- learn new languages quickly by comparing unfamiliar scripts to their visual vocalizations
- pronounce new words correctly in non-phonetic languages like English
- pronounce words correctly when languages share the same script but have different pronunciations, eg, 'A' in Dutch and English is pronounced differently.
