Speech Face lets you generate sounds by controlling a virtual mouth. Use the virtual mouth like a musical instrument with speech organs as its controls (ie, mouth, tongue, vocal cords and breath).  Speech Face is a visualization of the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (International Phonetic Alphabet). 

An alphabet has been created out of the speech positions for using as a common pronunciation guide for learning phonetics and languages. The speech position "letters" have been designed for easy reading, writing and compactness. As a common script it is intuitive to learn since it mimics actual speech, and acts as a base script for all other language scripts. It is a replacement for greek symbols based IPA, which is supposed provide a common pronunciation guide, but in practice is mainly used in academia and requires knowing the latin script.

Check out [Seeing Speech](https://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/ipa-charts/) from the University of Glasgow to see cross-sectional recordings of the face while making speech sounds.

Uses:
- pronounce language sounds by viewing speech organ positions rather than guessing from transliterations
- learn language sounds without the additional burden of memorizing abstract scripts. Makes it easier for kids to learn language.
- learn how to pronounce words by knowing which speech organs to control. Helps deaf and speech impaired people learn language sounds without guessing from mouth shapes.
- learn unfamiliar language scripts quickly by mapping them to their visual vocalizations. Helps voice actors and customer service representatives quickly learn accents and dialects of a language.
- pronounce new words correctly in non-phonetic languages like English. Helps native speakers learn new words without making assumptions.
- pronounce words without confusion when languages share the same script but have different pronunciations, eg, the letter A in Dutch and English. Helps language learners avoid inadvertently using their pronunciation rules for pronuncing foreigin words.
