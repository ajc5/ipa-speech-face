Interactive visualization demonstrating the anatomy of speech. It follows the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and it's designed to be used as a universal language script.

	Uses:
	- visualize any language sound accurately, unlike a transliteration
	- helps young kids learn language sounds without the additional burden of memorizing abstract scripts
	- helps the deaf, blind and speech impaired to learn how to pronounce naturally
	- learn new languages quickly by connecting unfamiliar scripts to their visual vocalizations
	- helps speakers of non-phonetic languages, eg, English and Chinese, pronounce new words
	- avoid confusion between languages that share the same script but assign different sounds, eg, 'A' in Dutch and English have different sounds.
